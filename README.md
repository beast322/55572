# Bubble Sort Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the performance of the Bubble Sort algorithm using different input sizes:
- 5 elements
- 10 elements
- 50 elements
- 100 elements

The algorithm was implemented in C++, and execution times were measured over multiple runs.

## Files
- `bubble_sort_analysis.cpp`: C++ implementation of Bubble Sort and timing code.
- `Bubble_Sort_Analysis_Report.docx`: Report summarizing the experiment, methodology, results, and analysis.
- `bubble_sort_graph.png`: Graph showing input size vs. average execution time.

## How to Run
1. Compile the C++ file:
   ```bash
   g++ bubble_sort_analysis.cpp -o sort_analysis
   ```
2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./sort_analysis
   ```

This will print the average execution time for each input size.
